				<h3>
					Keswick is an annual event held to worship our Lord together. It is a 4 day conference starting from December 26th and ending on the 29th. The attending people will get to vote on where the next venue will be hosted. This year's Keswick was supposed to be hosted in Barotac Veijo, but due to unforseen circumstances, it was moved to Central Philippine University (CPU). <br><br>
					This year's theme was "Turning Point Forgiven Forever" or (TPFF) which means that there will be a stage in your life that will be a turning point, and you will be forgiven by our God, if you confess your sins to Him, and follow Jesus.
